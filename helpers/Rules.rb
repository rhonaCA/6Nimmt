        puts 'This game has 104 cards, each bearing a number and 1 to 7 cattle heads icons that represent penalty points. A round of 10 turns is played where all players place one card of their choice out. The placed cards are placed on one of four rows according to the fixed rules. If the card needs to be placed onto a row that already has five cards than the player who place that card collects those five cards, which count as penalty points that are totalled up at the end of each round. Game will continue until a player collects 66 cattle heads or more, whereupon the player with the least cattle heads wins.'
